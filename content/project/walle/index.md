title: Litter Collecting Robot WALLE
summary: A litter collecting robot controlled by bluetooth of users' mobile phone. We applied Mecanum wheels to allow the robot to move in four directions, used HC-06 Bluetooth module and Arduino components to control the robot’s grabbing and movement, and designed a phone APP with convenient GUI incorporating Bluetooth function for users’ control.
